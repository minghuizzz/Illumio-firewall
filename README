To implement a Firewall class, there are several strategies considering the trade of time and space.
So I first implement an abstract class named Firewall so that I can implement several different firewall subclass.
This class contains an abstract method called acceptPacket which must be overridden by its subclasses.
And also have some non-abstract methods to be shared among its subclasses. (checkPort & checkIP)

Then I first consider the situation where the space of the system is limited.
In this case, we do not want to store the rules in any collections so that the space complexity could be O(1).
This means each time the acceptPacket method is called, the csv file should be read once.
And I use a for loop to check if the given parameters(direction, protocol, port, ip) are matched to any rules in the file.
So the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of rules in the file.

And then I consider the situation where the time matters more.
In this case, we want to store the rules of the file in some data structure, so that we can access quickly later.
Since the direction can only be "inbound" or "outbound"; the protocol can only be "tcp" or "udp";
the port can only be a integer between [1,65535]; and the ip address can only be in [0.0.0.0, 255,255,255,255],
we can simply use a boolean[2][2][65535][255][255][255][255] to represent the acceptable status of all combinations.
Yet if the number of rules is small, there will be plenty of unused space in the array. So we can use Map instead of arrays.
But in this assignment, I consider 65535 is not a very big constant. So I just use String[2][2][65535][1],
where each String in it is the ranges of ip address for the specific direction, protocol and port.
So when calling acceptPacket, we just access the array to get acceptable ip ranges and see if our ip is in them.
This may not be the best solution, but in 90 mins, this is the best I can do.
The optimization I can think of is to merge the ranges of ip address, instead of simply concatenating them.
And use Map to substitute the array of size 65535.

I used JUnit to test my functions. and in 90 minutes, I only wrote a simple csv file and several basic test cases.
And beyond 90 minutes, I added some test cases and some comments.

Finally, the teams I prefer are Platform Team and Data Team. 
I think I can be a good match for the position of the Platform Team.
The Data Team is also interested to me, but I think I might have to learn more things first if I entered the Data Team.

Thanks for the opportunity!
